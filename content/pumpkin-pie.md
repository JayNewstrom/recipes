#### Make the pie Crust:
- Place the flour, salt, and sugar in a food processor fitted with an “S” blade and pulse to combine.
- Add the vegan butter and cold water and process until the mixture resembles a coarse meal, begins to stick together, and holds together when pinched. 
- Remove dough from processor (will be crumbly) and form into a ball.
- Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 60 minutes or overnight
#### Make the filling:
- In a large bowl, beat the eggs. 
- Whisk in the pumpkin, coconut milk and vanilla extract until combined.
- Add sugar, salt, cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice and nutmeg and mix until completely combined.
#### Putting it together
- Preheat your oven to 425 degrees F.
- Lightly grease a pie plate and set aside.
- Roll out your pie dough on a well-floured surface (pastry cloth) to fit the size of your pie plate.
- Carefully transfer the dough to the pie plate and shape the crust how you want it to look.
- Pour the filling into the unbaked pie crust and cover the crust with a pastry shield
- Bake for 15 minutes at 425 degrees F. 
- Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F and continue to bake for 50 to 60 minutes, or until a knife inserted comes out clean.  It may be a bit wobbly still, but it will firm-up as it cools.
- Allow the pie to cool on a wire rack for 2 hours (Be patient! This is important).  Serve or refrigerate until ready to serve.
