- Preheat oven 400 deg
- Trim nubs and remove discolored brussels sprouts leaves, then cut in half lengthwise
- Transfer brussels to a large baking sheet, toss with light amount oil, arrange sprouts with flat end down and roast for 25-30 min until dark and caramelized ends. Toss halfway through.
- Meanwhile, prepare sauce in the smallest sauce pan. Add all sauce ingredients and whisk until combined.
- Bring mixture to boil and reduce heat to medium until sauce has thickened (~8-10 min). It's done when you remove from heat so no longer bubbling and then tilt pot carefully, the sauce will slide not slosh.
- Let brussels cool for a few minutes and then transfer to medium-sized serving bowl and pour sauce over them.
- Add garnishes and mix until combined. Serve.
