- Add ~1/3 cup refried beans and spread flat. 
- Continue layering with 1/4 avocado, 1/4 cup onion, 1/4 cup tomato or salsa, and 1/4 cup cilantro.
- Use your hands to flatten all the ingredients down so it's easier to roll.
- Tightly roll from one end to the other and place seam side down on a cutting board. If any ingredients fall out of the tortilla when rolling, it's OK! It's a hefty pinwheel, so just scrape it aside and move along.
- Starting in the center of the tortilla, use your hands to form and tighten the roll, moving outward toward the edges. This will help the fillings form together and make slicing easier.
- Use a serrated knife (blunt-edge knives may smash the pinwheel), and slice into 1/2-inch slices - about 8-10.
- Repeat the process with second tortilla and remaining ingredients. You should have ~20 pinwheels.
