- 1 head cauliflower, cut into bite size pieces
- 1 head broccoli, cut into bite size pieces
- 3 medium carrots, cut into coins
- 1 cup brown rice, I nearly always use quick-cook brown rice
- 2 cups cooked chickpeas, or 1 can, rinsed and drained
- 2 tbsp sesame seeds
- 2 tsp extra virgin olive oil
- salt/pepper
#### Creamy Sweet Tahini Dressing
- ¼ cup tahini
- 4 tbsp balsamic vinegar
- 3 tbsp pure maple syrup
- 1 garlic clove (minced)
- 3 tbsp nutritional yeast
- ¼ cup water (plus more as needed to thin)
- salt/pepper to taste

- Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
- Cook the rice according to package directions. 
- Spread cauliflower and broccoli on one baking sheet. Spread chickpeas and carrots on another baking sheet. Drizzle 1 tsp oil over each baking sheet and give veggies a toss. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.
- Roast for 20-30 minutes, turning the pans and giving them a shake every ten minutes. Cauliflower and broccoli takes about 30 minutes, carrots and chickpeas take about 20, so start the broccoli/cauliflower first and put the chickpeas/carrots in after the first 10 minutes. (Every oven is different, so keep an eye on everything to make sure you don't burn them.)
- Combine all dressing ingredients in a small bowl  or cup and whisk until smooth. Add more water, as needed, to thin. Set aside.
- When veggies and chickpeas are done, make your bowls! A little rice, broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, chickpeas, sesame seeds and dressing in each individual bowl. This is also good with BBQ sauce rather than the tahini sauce.
