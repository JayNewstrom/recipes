- Prepare rice
- Prepare "chicken", using tofu, potatoes, cauliflower, etc. (I like to use 5 potatoes, chopped into small pieces, cooked in the oven for 20 minutes at 400 F, flipping halfway through)
- Melt the vegan butter in a large pan over medium-high heat.
- Saute the onion for 3-4 minutes in the butter, then add the ginger and garlic and cook for 1 more minute.
- Add the spices, salt, tomato paste and coconut milk. Stir until smooth and combined. Simmer for 5-10 minutes, stirring frequently.
- Add the "chicken" to the sauce, server over rice and add toppings.
