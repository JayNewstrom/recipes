- Preheat oven to 425f
- If making rice or quinoa, cook it according to directions first.
- Roast the Cauliflower: Toss Cauliflower with olive oil, salt and spices in a large bowl, and place in a single layer, on parchement-lined sheet pans (you may need two. Cut the bell pepper in half and place on the same sheet pan open side down. Roast 12 minutes, turn cauliflower over, rotating racks  ( top rack will cook faster) and  cook another 12-15 minutes, until nice and golden, and fork-tender.
- Make the Chimichurri Sauce
- Season the blackbeans: Warm up the black beans in a small pot on the stove, adding water, spices, salt and oil.
- Assemble Bowls: Layer rice and beans, top with roasted cauliflower. Drizzle with a little chimichurri sauce and garnish with the slaw, avocado, pickled onions, sprouts and cilantro.

#### Chimichurri Sauce
- Using a food processor; place onion, garlic, and fresh chili if using, and pulse several times until very finely chopped. Add cilantro (tender stems are fine) Italian parsley, and oregano, pulse again until chopped. Add olive oil, lime juice,  smoked paprika (optional), salt and pepper. Pulse a few more times, until well combined (but not too smooth). If the mixture seems thick add a little more oil to loosen it up.
- Taste, adjust salt, lime and heat (add more chilies or chili flakes) to your liking. If it tastes bitter, check your olive oil.
- Sprinkle with chili flakes and few cilantro leaves.
- This will keep up to 4 days in the fridge, or freeze.
