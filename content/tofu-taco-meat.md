- Preheat oven to 350F (180C)
- Line with parchment paper or lightly grease a large baking sheet
- Mix the oil, soy sauce, and spices in a large bowl
- Crumble the tofu with your fingers into the bowl of seasoning
- Mix the tofu crumbles with the seasoning until evenly coated
- Spread the tofu crumbles evenly over the baking sheet
- Bake for 30-35 minutes, stirring the tofu occasionally so it doesn't burn
- Bake until the tofu is browned
- Smaller crumbles will be darker than the larger pieces but this provides a nice variety in texture
- Remove the tofu from the oven and combine with the salsa
