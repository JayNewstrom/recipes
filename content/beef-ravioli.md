#### Filling
- Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the ground beef, onion, and garlic and cook, stirring frequently, until the beef is cooked and the onion is tender.
- Drain off any excess grease. Remove the skillet from the heat and stir in the parsley, and salt. Mix well then stir in the egg. 
- Transfer the beef mixture to a covered container and refrigerate while you prepare the rest of the recipe.

#### Dough
- Place the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Mix until a stiff dough forms.
- Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface and knead until smooth and elastic. 
- Cover the dough with plastic wrap and let rest for 30 minutes.
- Divide the dough into 4 equal pieces. 
- Roll out one piece of dough on the floured surface to form a 12x8-inch rectangle. Lightly score a grid of 24 2-inch squares with a knife.
- Place a teaspoon of the beef filling in the center of each square.
- Roll out a second piece of dough to a 12x8-inch rectangle. Carefully place on top of the first sheet of dough. Press the dough down around the filling and edges to seal.
- Carefully cut the dough into squares around each mound of filling. Seal the edges as needed of each piece.
- Place the ravioli on a kitchen towel in a single layer and let dry for 30 minutes. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling.

#### Cook
- Bring a large saucepan of salted water to a boil over high heat.
- Add the ravioli and cook, stirring just to keep the pieces from sticking.
- Bring to a boil then reduce the heat to a strong simmer.
- Cook about 5 minutes or until al dente.
- Drain well.
- Place the cooked ravioli in individual serving bowls.
- Top with the marinara sauce.
- Sprinkle with parmesan cheese if desired.
