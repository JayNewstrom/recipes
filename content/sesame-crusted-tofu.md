- Cut the tofu into 1 inch (2 cm) slices.
- Combine the remaining marinated tofu ingredients in a shallow bowl. Add the tofu slices and marinate for at least 30 minutes, flipping occasionally.
- Meanwhile, cook the rice according to the package directions.
- Get the coating station ready. On one plate, combine the cornstarch, salt and pepper. On a second plate, add the milk. On a third plate, combine the panko and sesame seeds. Set aside.
- Add all the sauce ingredients to a saucepan. Whisk until the cornstarch is well dissolved, then bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook for 5 minutes to thicken, stirring often. Set aside.
- Once the tofu is marinated, coat the tofu slices first in the cornstarch mixture.
- Then, dip briefly in the milk.
- Finally, coat in the panko and sesame mix.
- Heat up the oil in a large pan on medium-high. When hot, add the tofu slices.
- Fry until crisp and golden on each side. Transer to a wire rack to cool.
- To assemble, place the rice, add the crusted tofu on top, drizzle the sauce over the tofu and garnish with any desired veggies.
