- Cook potatoes (20-30 minutes) 
- Once cooked, drain, add back to the pot to evaporate any remaining water, then transfer to a mixing bowl.
- Mash until smooth. Add vegan butter, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Loosely cover and set aside.
- In a large saucepan over medium heat, saute onions and garlic in 1 Tbsp olive oil until lightly browned and caramelized - about 5 minutes.
- Add a pinch each salt and pepper. Then add lentils, stock, and thyme and stir. Bring to a low boil. Then reduce heat to simmer. Continue cooking until lentils are tender (35-40 minutes).
- In the last 10 minutes of cooking, add the frozen veggies, stir, and cover to meld the flavors together.
- While cooking, preheat oven to 425 degrees F and lightly grease a 9x13 pan.
- Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. Then transfer to your prepared oven-safe baking dish and carefully top with mashed potatoes. Smooth down with a spoon or fork and season with another crack of pepper and a little sea salt.
- Bake for 10-15 minutes or until the mashers are lightly browned on top.
- Let cool briefly before serving. The longer it sits, the more it will thicken.
