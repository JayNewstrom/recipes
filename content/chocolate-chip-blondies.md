- Preheat oven to 350°, line a 9x9 baking sheet with parchment paper, chop chocolate bar (if using)
- In a large bowl combine melted butter, brown sugar, eggs and vanilla with wooden spoon or spatula. Mix wet mixture for at least 1 minute (don’t skip this!).
- Add dry ingredients to wet, mix until combined. Mix in chocolate chips and any small shavings from chocolate bar.
- Spread into baking pan. Place chopped chocolate bar on top. Bake at 350° until a toothpick comes out clean, 35-45 minutes. Cool for at least 2 hours before cutting
- Cut into bars. Goes great with salted caramel drizzle on top!
