- Prepare noodles according to package directions. When they are cooked, drain and set aside.
- In a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat, brown the beef, breaking it up into pieces as it cooks.
- Add the onions to the Dutch oven and sauté, stirring frequently, until translucent and soft – about 5 minutes.
- Sprinkle the flour over the beef and onion, stirring to evenly coat and allow the flour to absorb oil.
- Add the beef broth, milk, corn starch, Dijon, Worcestershire, and beef bouillon to the Dutch oven. Stir until combined, and allow the sauce to simmer until thickened.
- Toss the noodles to coat evenly with the sauce. Adjust seasoning with salt & pepper and garnish with parsley before serving.
