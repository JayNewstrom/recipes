- Preheat the oven to 325°F and set an oven rack in the middle position.
- Generously grease two 8 x 4-inch loaf pans with butter and dust with flour.
- In a medium bowl, combine the flour, salt, baking soda, baking powder, cloves, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Whisk until well combined; set aside.
- In a large bowl of an electric mixer, beat the butter and sugar on medium speed until just blended. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Continue beating until very light and fluffy, a few minutes. Beat in the pumpkin. The mixture might look grainy and curdled at this point -- that's okay.
- Add the flour mixture and mix on low speed until combined.
- Turn the batter into the prepared pans, dividing evenly, and bake for 55 – 65 minutes, or until a cake tester inserted into the center comes out clean.
- Let the loaves cool in the pans for about 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.
