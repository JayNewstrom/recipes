{{% instructions %}}
- Cook beans if using dried (instant pot 30 minutes + 20 minute natural release)
- Pre-heat oven to 450 degrees. Begin cooking rice.
- Chop onions, jalapeños and tomatoes. Place on baking sheet, making sure not to crowd. On 2nd baking sheet place poblano peppers, making sure not to crowd. Drizzle olive oil over veggies and season salt/pepper to taste.
- Roast above for ~15 minutes and remove poblano peppers when tender to cool. Roast rest of veggies for an additional 15 minutes.
- While veggies are roasting: 
  - Begin cooking garlic on a skillet. Once cooked, place into blender along with 2 teaspoons cumin, 1 teaspoon coriander, 1 teaspoon oregano, salt, cilantro. 
  - Season black beans with 1 teaspoon of cumin and 1 teaspoon of chili powder and salt to taste. 
  - When rice is cooked and slightly cooled season rice with some cut cilantro and lime juice. 
  - Lastly, cut poblanos from stem to tip, remove seeds and rinse with cold water to remove all seeds. It’s okay if the skin peels off slightly.
- Keep oven on. Once onions fully roasted, remove 1/3 of onions and dice and place into seasoned black beans. The rest of the veggies (tomato, garlic, onion, jalapeños) will be placed into blender and blend until smooth, add water to thin as desired (~1/4 cup). Blend sauce and set aside.
- In a large baking dish, pour a little sauce on bottom of pan. Place poblano peppers over top of sauce, slit side up and spoon in seasoned rice, seasoned black beans, and top with sauce and cheese.
- Cover dish with tin foil and bake for 20 minutes at 425 degrees. Uncover and bake for additional 5 minutes. Garnish with cilantro, sour cream, etc.
