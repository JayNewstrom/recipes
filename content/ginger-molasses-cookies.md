- Combine the ground flax meal and water in a small ramekin. Let this rest for 10 minutes, stirring it occasionally. This mixture is called a flax egg. Set aside.
- Into a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, ginger, cinnamon, cloves, and salt. Set aside.
- Into a large-sized mixing bowl, add in the vegan butter, cane sugar, and brown sugar. Use a handheld beater to cream the ingredients together for 4 minutes at medium speed. With a rubber spatula, scrape down the edges of the bowl as needed.
- Add the molasses and the flax egg into the creamed butter-sugar mixture. Beat this at medium speed for 2 minutes.
- Now, add 1/2 cup of the dry mix into the wet mixture. Beat over low speed until combined. Repeat these steps until there is no dry mix left, and everything is thoroughly combined to create a dough.
- Tightly wrap the cookie dough in plastic wrap and chill it in the refrigerator for 2 hours.
- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and line a couple of large sheet pans with parchment paper.
- Divide the dough into 2 tablespoon-sized balls. You should get 19 balls.
- Press the balls into small discs that are roughly 1/4th inch thick and 3 inches in diameter.
- Place the heavy 1/4 cup of brown sugar to coat the cookies in a wide, shallow bowl. Coat both sides of the cookie discs in the sugar.
- Place the cookie discs on a parchment paper-lined sheet pan 2 inches apart from each other.
- Bake just one sheet pan of cookies at a time and on the middle oven rack for 10 minutes.
- Optional, but I like to sprinkle on a little more brown sugar immediately after the cookies come out of the oven just for aesthetics.
