- Prepare pasta according to package directions.
- Add the vegan butter to a saucepan along with the minced garlic, and onion; heat until the butter is melted.
- Sift in the flour and fry the flour in the butter briefly.
- Add in the coconut milk and vegetable stock and whisk with a hand whisk to remove any lumps.
- Stir continuously until the sauce begins to boil, reduce to simmer continuing to stir until it thickens (about 5 minutes). The sauce will continue to thicken as it cools, so it doesnâ€™t need to be the perfect thickness when you remove it from the heat, but it must have thickened quite a bit from when you started.
- Heat 2 cups of frozen pees in the microwave.
- Remove from heat and add in the black pepper, dijon mustard and nutritional yeast and whisk in with your hand whisk. Add sea salt to taste.
- Toss the sauce with the cooked pasta and peas; serve with chopped parsley and a sprinkle of black pepper and some vegan parmesan cheese (optional).
