- Begin by turning on the instant pot and adding 12 ounces of pasta along with 3 cups of water.
- Select pressure cook and set the timer to 6 minutes (on high pressure).
- Close the lid and set the valve to sealing. The Instant Pot will take a few minutes to come to pressure, then it will count down 5 minutes.
- Once the 5 minute timer is over, set the valve to venting and release the steam until the floating pin drops.
- Then, open the lid and stir the pasta and make sure none is sticking.
- Set the Instant Pot to 'keep warm.’
- Next, add coconut milk, fresh torn or sliced basil, fresh baby spinach, and sun-dried tomatoes.
- Combine and stir until spinach is fully wilted and no excess cooking liquid remains.
- Once fully cooked, the final step is just to add the seasonings. Taste and adjust seasonings to your liking.
