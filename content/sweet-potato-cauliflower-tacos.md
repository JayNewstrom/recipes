- Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Line 1 large baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.
- Prep the veggies: Place the cauliflower florets and diced sweet potato in a large bowl. Drizzle the olive oil over top, then season with the chili powder, cumin, paprika, garlic powder, oregano and salt. Squeeze the lime juice over top. Toss to combine. Transfer the veggies to the prepared baking dish, arranging everything in a uniform layer, with lots of breathing room.
- Roast the veggies for 25 minutes, giving the baking sheets a good shake about halfway through. Add the black beans to the sheet pan, then place the pan back in the oven for 5 more minutes to heat the black beans through. Remove from the oven and set aside.
- Prep taco assembly: Meanwhile, as the veggies roast, prep the rest of your taco fixins:
- Prep the chipotle lime cashew sauce: Add all listed ingredients in a high-speed blender. Blend to combine. Set aside.
- Assemble the roasted veggie tacos: Smear some guacomole on each tortilla. Top with a generous scoop of roasted veggies. Drizzle some chipotle lime cashew sauce over top. Finish with some freshly chopped cilantro.
