- Grab all items first.
- Boil salted water for noodles.
- While water coming to a boil, in a large bowl, whisk together all dressing ingredients until smooth.
- Begin prepping veggies with broccoli first. Keep broccoli separate from other veggies, place other veggies in large bowl.
- Cook noodle per directions until just short of al dente (3-4 minutes if using soba noodles). Drain immediately and add noodles and 1 tsp of sesame oil to dressing bowl and toss for even coating. Set aside.
- Cook broccoli in medium skillet over medium-high heat with some oil. Stir occasionally until broccoli lightly charred (5 min). Continue cutting veggies.
- Once broccoli charred, turn down heat and stir in 1 TBSP sesame oil, garlic, and cook until fragrant (30 sec). Remove from heat and toss with hoisin sauce, lime juice, and sesame until evenly coated.
- To the bowl with noodles, add carrots, cabbage, peas, and broccoli and toss until well combined.
- Garnish with green onions, cilantro, and sesame seeds. Serve.
