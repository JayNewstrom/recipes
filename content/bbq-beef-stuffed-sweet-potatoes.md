- Poke the sweet potatoes with a fork multiple times on all sides.
- Wrap each sweet potato in a damp paper towel.  Place the sweet potatoes on a microwave safe plate and cook for 5 minutes in the microwave.
- Turn the sweet potatoes over (careful, they will be HOT!) and cook for an additional 5-10 minutes or until a fork goes all the way through the potatoes with ease.  You will need to cook them a bit longer depending on how many sweet potatoes you have in the microwave at a time.
- While the sweet potatoes are cooking, add 1 tbsp olive oil to a large pan over medium high heat.
- Cook the meat until it is cooked through (about 8-10 minutes).
- Add the seasonings to the pan with 2 tbsp water.  Stir to coat the meat in the seasoning.  Heat for an additional 2-3 minutes.
- Once the potatoes are done cooking, cut them open length wise and fill with the BBQ Turkey.
- Optionally top with your favorite BBQ sauce.
